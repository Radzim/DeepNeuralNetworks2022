# DeepNeuralNetworks2022

Part A:
In these questions we will work with residual networks (ResNets).
- Transformations
- Trying different pretrained networks
- Inspecting and modifying networks
- Inspecting layers in neural networks
- Editing models
- Dropping layers in ResNet15
- Flattening ResNets
- Dropping layers in ResNet50
- Permuting and Repeating Layers

Part B:
In these questions we will work with recurrent networks (RNNs).
- Creating the dataset
- Building a classifier
- Evaluating the loss
- Training the classifier
- Improving the SGD code
- Testing on longer sequences
- Better models (LSTMs, GRUs)
- Non-RNN networks
- Visualising memorization

Part C:
(not so)Mini-Project: Adversarial examples for ResNets
- Performing a simple FGSM attack
- Arbitrary Target FGSM
- Advanced attacks
- Attacks on other networks
- Testing the same perturbation on other networks
- Testing a perturbation on other images using the same network
- Black-Box adversarial attacks
